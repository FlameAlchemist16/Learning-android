Starting with android development

This repo actually contain a very very simple android application. This marks the very first begining of my android development. This app was based on some of the basic layouts and views of android development. Moreover it provided an opportunity to intract and get used to various features that are being provided by android studio. This app was developed side by side with a course provided by Udacity under the name "Android Basics: User Interface".
